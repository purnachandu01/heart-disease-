# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models (specifically, a Random Forest classifier) to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data. The model is visualized using Graphviz to interpret decision-making paths.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `heart disease.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with data loading, preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
- `heart.csv` – Dataset used to train the model.
- `requirements.txt` – List of required Python packages.
- `heart_disease_tree.dot` / `heart_disease_tree.png` – Graphviz visualization of a decision tree (optional output).
